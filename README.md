**This is a mock repository.** 

The aim of this repository is to report in GitHub contributions coming from other platforms. Specifically contributions I made during my job at Asseco.

It has been created using (https://github.com/miromannino/contributions-importer-for-github)

## Notice

The content of this repository contains mock code. This prevents private source code to be leaked. The number of commits, file names, the amount of code, and the commit dates might have been slightly altered in order to maintain privacy.
